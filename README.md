COMMENTS

If i had more time i would have liked to add some validation to the form to only accept numeric values (along with pound adn pence signs).

Also i would have liked to implement more of an OO approach, such as a better implementation of encapulsaton and other OO techniques.

Also, i have never used unit testing such as QUnit or Jasmine before. I have only ever touched upon TDD in PHP with PHPUnit testing.

Many thanks
